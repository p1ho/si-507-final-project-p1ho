SI 507 Final Project Proposal Resubmission
Pokuan Ho 35499722

========================================================================
Summary:

I plan to build a program that lets user choose an NBA player (has to be a valid name spelled correctly) and shows:
 - Player injury history (In the form of an infographic like annotated dots on a full body graphic)


# The following are removed because I might not be able to address them all, but kept for reference (or good ideas for later)
1) Their team history (which will show up on the US MAP using Plotly)
2) Their injury history (I will need to see if it's possible to create a human body heatmap, but if not, probably a line graph)
3) Their stats history by season, which will require user to decide a type beforehand (Points Scored, Block Shots, etc.)
4) (If first 3 are completed with no complications) Their most recent news (injury updates, trade news, etc.)

========================================================================
Data Source:

FOX SPORTS Webpage (Has to crawl multiple pages in a site I haven't used before) - 8 points
Link: https://www.foxsports.com/nba
An couple examples of pages to be crawled:
https://www.foxsports.com/nba/terry-rozier-player-stats
https://www.foxsports.com/nba/terry-rozier-player-injuries

# Removed: FOX SPORTS API only provide news, no injury reports
(If Doing 4) FOX SPORTS API (https://newsapi.org/s/fox-sports-api) - haven't used before, requires API key - 4 Points

There are currently over 300 active players in the NBA and I would have to scrape all those records, so it should fulfill the requirement of capturing at least 100 records.

========================================================================
Data Access and Storage:

I plan to have a SQLite database that will store several related tables for me (one for player, one for team, one for injury)
Since I'm going to scrape multiple pages, I will cache the HTML, though the resulting cache (over 300 pages) will probably be quite huge.

========================================================================
Data Processing:

I will use user input to generate SQL queries to gather data,
and pass those data to plotly so results show up in nice graphics.

========================================================================
Presentation Options:

Users will be able to choose whether they want to see data just in text (which will be nicely formatted), or whether they want to see it in plotly.
I might also include an option that let users export the data they want to see so they don't have to run the program everytime to get the data.
As mentioned in the summary, the type of data that will be displayed are:
 - Player injury history (In the form of an infographic like annotated dots on a full body graphic)

========================================================================
Presentation tools:

For text based data, it will be presented in the commandline (or I will include an option to export the data into a txt or csv)
For graphical data, I will utilize Plotly which will generate a nicely formatted graphics very quickly.
 - One for Injury History (See if a Human Graph is possible, like a much less glamorous version of this http://i.imgur.com/5Xiq1C2.jpg)
 - I have already found a good picture that could be used as the backgroud https://userscontent2.emaze.com/images/0e8ac80a-9117-45a0-b503-41d01ee8ddfa/cefc4149-a2d4-4432-b328-e4c1b3fd0a7a.jpg

Depending on how the project goes, I may consider porting this to a web based interface (because it'd be cool to have a page that shows a graphical representation of any player's injury over the years, which I don't see that exist yet)
