SI 507 Final Project Proposal
Pokuan Ho 35499722

========================================================================
Summary:

I plan to build a program that lets user choose an NBA player (has to be a valid name spelled correctly) and shows:
1) Their team history (which will show up on the US MAP using Plotly)
2) Their injury history (I will need to see if it's possible to create a human body heatmap, but if not, probably a line graph)
3) Their stats history by season, which will require user to decide a type beforehand (Points Scored, Block Shots, etc.)
4) (If first 3 are completed with no complications) Their most recent news (injury updates, trade news, etc.)

========================================================================
Data Source:

FOX SPORTS Webpage (Has to crawl multiple pages in a site I haven't used before) - 8 points
Link: https://www.foxsports.com/nba
An couple examples of pages to be crawled:
https://www.foxsports.com/nba/terry-rozier-player-stats
https://www.foxsports.com/nba/terry-rozier-player-injuries

(If Doing 4) FOX SPORTS API (https://newsapi.org/s/fox-sports-api) - haven't used before, requires API key - 4 Points

There are currently over 300 active players in the NBA and I would have to scrape all those records, so it should fulfill the requirement of capturing at least 100 records.

========================================================================
Data Access and Storage:

I plan to have a SQLite database that will store several related tables for me (one for player, one for stats, one for team, one for injury)
Since I'm going to scrape multiple pages, I will cache the HTML, though the resulting cache will probably be quite huge.
If I end up doing 4 with the API, I will also cache the results in JSON format, but with a stale checker since player news get updated very quickly.

========================================================================
Data Processing:

I will use user input to generate SQL queries to gather data,
and pass those data to plotly so results show up in nice graphics.

========================================================================
Presentation Options:

Users will be able to choose whether they want to see data just in text (which will be nicely formatted), or whether they want to see it in plotly.
I might also include an option that let users export the data they want to see so they don't have to run the program everytime to get the data.
As mentioned in the summary, the types of data that will be displayed are:
1) Player team history (which will show up on the US MAP using Plotly)
2) Player injury history (which will be a line graph/bar graph)
3) Player stats history by season, which will require user to decide a type beforehand (Points Scored, Block Shots, etc.)
4) (If first 3 are completed with no complications) Their most recent news (injury updates, trade news, etc.)

========================================================================
Presentation tools:

For text based data, it will be presented in the commandline (or I will include an option to export the data into a txt or csv)
For graphical data, I will utilize Plotly which will generate a nicely formatted graphics very quickly.
Even though Plotly will be heavily used, there will be several very different types of graphs:
 - One for Team History (USA Map)
 - One for Stats (Bar Graph)
 - One for Injury History (See if a Human Graph is possible, like a much less glamorous version of this http://i.imgur.com/5Xiq1C2.jpg)
For the Team history map, it would be nice if it doesn't just show a star at where they played, but an actual team logo, but I need to figure out whether that is possible with Plotly (inserting custom graphics)

Depending on how the project goes, I may consider porting this to a web based interface (because it'd be cool to have a page that shows a graphical representation of any player's injury over the years, which I don't see that exist yet)
